# Palmer Penguins Analysis using Statistical Methods

This repository contains an R Markdown report titled **`Penguin.Rmd`** which presents a statistical analysis of the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). The report applies a range of exploratory and inferential methods to understand patterns and relationships in penguin species across the Palmer Archipelago.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to apply statistical techniques to analyze biological measurements and distribution data of three penguin species:
- **Adelie**
- **Chinstrap**
- **Gentoo**

The analysis investigates:
- Species distribution across islands
- Physical characteristics such as bill length, body mass, and flipper length
- Differences between male and female penguins
- Hypothesis testing and data visualization

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis was conducted using **R** and includes the following packages:

- `palmerpenguins`
- `ggplot2`
- `GGally`
- `vegan`
- `gridExtra`
- `knitr`

## Contents

Key sections of the report:

1. **Introduction**
2. **Data Preparation**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Summary Statistics**
5. **Visualizations (Boxplots, Pair Plots)**
6. **Hypothesis Testing**

## Getting Started

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `Penguin.Rmd` file in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio/).
3. Click the **Knit** button to render the report in HTML or PDF format.

Or use this R command:

```r
rmarkdown::render("Penguin.Rmd")
